thesis: "The fact that people tend to focus on the negative is responsible for progress. In a very real way, it's not a bug, it's a feature."

I was reading [this cracked article](http://www.cracked.com/article_20398_5-ways-your-brain-tricking-you-into-being-miserable.html), and I was struck by how fatalistic the whole thesis is. They are making their assertion in no uncertain terms:

### 5 Ways Your Brain Is Tricking You into Being Miserable

Wow. Tricking me? Miserable? Yikes.

I wanted to turn my attention to the first of the five points, and argue that it doesn't at all mean I'm doomed to be unhappy.

### #5. Your Brain Latches onto the Bad Stuff by Design

Alright, does the fact that my brain notices and remembers negative things more easily than positive ones mean I will be unhappy?

Well no, because of neuroplasticity and positive psychology and attitude adjustment and brains hacks and stuff... but also:

### Our negative focused brains are responsible for progress.

That's what's driven humanity our current heights, the fact that people focus on the problems. We need people to be discontent with what we have, we need to search for problems and aggressively solve them.

If someone's life is 90% perfect, but that 10% of irritation or inefficiency exists, then that's where their attention should be focused. It's certainly true that good things take effort to maintain, but usually if they became good in the first place then the solutions are in place to keep them that way. But the remaining problems don't have solutions in place.

Essentially, we should focus on the negative because those are the things we haven't figured out yet.

I've found many times in my life, that I could *get used* to stuff. Pretty much anything. I could eventually get used to getting 2 hours of sleep a night because of my newborn baby. I could eventually get used to working sixteen hour days because I'm constantly beating myself up for not doing enough. I could eventually get used to anything if given time. But that's not acceptable. When things aren't right, a well-functioning mind figures out how they could be better, and insists on changing them. Settling for a bad status quo is never something that should happen.

This Bruce Lee quote comes to mind:

> Be happy, but never satisfied.

Whenever we simply say "Yeah, I'm good with my life exactly as it is", we stop growing. It's why so many people's health spirals out of control when they get married, because the only force driving them to maintain their health was their motivation to be attractive and find a sexual partner. Once that impetus is gone (it's never really gone, you need to maintain yourself *for* your partner if you already have one), people just can't find a reason to put up with the pain and inconvenience, that is until their body starts falling apart and the doctor visits begin.

The main force driving you forward should be *yourself*. Being satisfied is short for being stagnant, and that's not ever something I want to be.

This is not to say that we shouldn't be happy, or should let the negative in life distract us from the joys of life when we've decided to enjoy them. But that's the point, and I think a perfect way of clearly delineating the difference between work and play. Work is when you choose to focus on the negative, because by definition work is about improvement, and problems are what need to be improved. Play is when you choose to focus on the positive, because you are trying to make that the happy time of your life, the memories you'll look back on with fondness.

People very often do incredibly difficult and arduous and painful things for fun, and I think the reason it works is because of the choice they've made about those activities, to focus on the positive. All sports are ultimately about pain and work and competition, but people focus on the positive aspects of those things and they're therefore play. And people do very traditionally fun things for work, like artistic things or comedy or socializing and networking, but they're able to do them on a higher level than other people because instead of focusing on the positive in order to enjoy them and thereby missing the details that need to be ironed out, they focus on the negative so they are constantly driven to improve their work.

I think the difference between people who can focus on the negative in a productive way and those who let it depress or irritate them isn't because of focusing on the negative or positive, but rather their attitudes about the *future* and what they can do about those problems. Even if you're focusing on the negative, if you have an attitude that those negative things can be fixed with effort and consideration, then you'll be happy still. Those negative things won't destroy your day or make you depressed, because they can and therefore invariably will get better and be solved. This all comes down to the optimist/realist/pessimist question, and the unavoidable truth that realism is always always always the best of the three when actually going about life. Realism

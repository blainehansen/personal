I've heard the credo that done is better than perfect, but I want to change that a little, to:

### Done *Comes Before* Perfect

Why the change? I feel as developers that we're rarely very worried about creating maintainable code. We get things working, and then we immediately forget about it, work on something else, and find that when we have to revisit that code it causes us a lot of pain. I think more developers should build a "let's hone and simplify the thing we just finished" stage to their development cycles. It would solve a lot of problems before they start.

Similarly, I believe that:

### Ergonomics Comes Before Performance

Ergonomics allow you to get something done, Performance is a measure of how perfect it is.

### Completion Comes Before Quality

### Product Comes Before

There are two types of jobs: production jobs and system jobs. A production job requires you to act as the mechanism in producing some sort of value, and system job requires you to act as a part of a system that creates value. System jobs make sense to be paid hourly and have hourly expectations, since you're functioning in synchronous concert with other people to form a complete system, and the system is the value provider. In production, deadlines are the only logical type of time-based expectation, since you provide the value by yourself rather than firing in tandem with other people to create it.

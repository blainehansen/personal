A description of the problem:
	* we have a segmented and cluttered social networking ecosystem
	* the companies are intentionally locking us in, which makes it impossible for us to punish them for surveillance or data bubbling or nosy advertisements by simply leaving their tools
	* social networking hasn't actually delivered on it's promise to connect us to anyone we want to connect to, because we can't connect to someone if they aren't inside one of the "bubbles" we've actually joined
	* sites are duplicating effort and wasting their users' time by all solving the same connection and distribution problem many times in many different ways, none of which actually add value to the service, but just get it to the "social app" baseline. They need to recognize the difference between content creation and content distribution and sharing. Distribution and sharing is the logical conclusion of the internet, and a protocol can universally solve that problem. An app really adds value when they augment the content creation process.


A description of the solution provided by the protocol:
	* users can post content to a persistent feed
	* users can make one way connections to one another, with those connections being the only thing the two parties must mutually agree to. Permissions and filters can then give each side of the connection the level of control they need over those connections.
	* users can connect their account to content creation apps that would perhaps automatically push anything you create to your feed
	* there should be a special message type that is a "notification", that connected apps could use rather than cluttering the user's feed with messages
	* users can of course then read the content from their aggregated connections
	* users can send private messages, with a new instant message protocol (perhaps an extension of the email protocol)
	* users can export all of their data, and up and move to any system they want


A description of the superiority of this solution:
	* unified, simple, clean
	* people can *actually* connect with anyone in the world. It is a truly social network, because it would be universal
	* people can make and include any kind of content without relying on the creation app's distribution mechanisms. This would prevent that content being locked in to the app it was created in.
	* when a social app betrays or fails it's users, or simply just doesn't really add any value, people will be able to abandon it the way they should! En masse! They won't have to give up their connections or their data, just the failed interface they leave behind.
	* people could even implement their *own personal site*. Personal blogs or professional websites could be transformed from simple data hosting systems to complete connection apps, with their own personalized solutions to the social networking app
	* the google plus dream of being able to actually control who sees what and organize your social world doesn't have to die, and would be opened up to any solution anyone could dream up

title: "Realism is Best, Always Always Always"
---

I'm going to ask you a question: when you say you're a pessimist/optimist, are you saying you believe the future *will* follow that path? Or are you saying that you believe the future *should* follow that path?

This is important. When working in the functional realm of *prediction*, or when we're trying to figure out what *will* happen, realism is the only one that makes any kind of sense. Saying the world will absolutely get better or worse always over time is stupid, and doesn't acknowledge the supreme overriding nature of causality. Whatever happens will happen, and only because of the things that caused it, regardless of good or bad.

But then, when we're in the aspirational realm of what we believe *can* happen or what we will focus on *making* happen, an idealistic stance is the only one that isn't a waste of time. Being a realist is redundant, since saying "I believe the world can be what it will be according to causality, and I'm working to make sure that happens" is a statement without any content, and being a pessimist is actively evil? Or simply pointless because why would we ardently believe the world can get worse when we're sitting here in the now with the power to do something about it?

Predictive, what we think will happen
Aspirational, what we're trying to make happen

People are always arguing about this for some reason. Allow me to do everyone a big favor and just clear this up real quick.

Idealism is the belief that things *will* get better. Notice how no consideration is taken to *how* they will get better, or to whether it's necessary for anyone to take action to make them better.

Pessimism is the belief that things *will* get worse. Similarly to optimism, notice how nothing else is considered.

Realism is the belief that things will simply be. Things will happen according to cause and effect relationships, and that's it. Notice how that assumption isn't fucking stupid.

So, realism is the only one that isn't stupid and delusional. Interesting huh?

**But Blaine!!** I hear you saying, **I do genuinely believe that the world will get better, but I have plans and ideas about how that will happen and I'm living my life with that goal!**

Great! Notice how, since you are actually doing things and have been thinking through how the problems *need* to get solved, you've taken a *realistic* stance on the matter? Yep, no matter how much of a *positive outlook* you have on the future, you're still being a realist if you acknowledge humanity's responsibility to *create* that future rather than wait around for it to arrive on its own.

I guess I should have just put this quote up very first thing.

> The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.

**But Blaine! Some realists are depressing! They're always pointing out only the awful things about the world and never suggesting solutions! I realize they're right about those awful things, but they have a bad attitude about it!**

So there we have it. The real difference between what we consider 

Proactive realism. When you Acknowledge that there are legitimately awful problems in the world, and that there are many obstacles to solving them, some of them deeply rooted in human nature or the laws of the universe. But also believe that with sufficient analysis, understanding, and targeted effort, even the most ubiquitous problems can be solved or at least abated.

Whenever anyone says they're an optimist or a pessimist, just slap them in the face. Neither of those are based in reality, and make assumptions about the future. Everyone should be a realist all the time. Obviously everyone will still have different visions of a better future, and different fears for bad things that could happen in the future, and different plans for making the future good instead of bad, but everyone should be a realist. Always.
